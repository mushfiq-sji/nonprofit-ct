    question: "How do I connect my CRM?",

  {
    question: "What does the Data Health score mean?",

  },
  {
    question: "How do AI agents work?",

  },
  {
    question: "Can I customize the dashboard for my role?",

  {
    question: "Is my data secure?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. We use row-level security policies so users only see data they're authorized to access. Activity logs track all changes for full auditability.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I invite team members?",
    answer:
      "Administrators can invite team members from the Admin Panel → User Management. Each user can be assigned a role (Executive Director, Development Director, Finance Manager, or Operations Manager) which determines their dashboard and permissions.",
  },
  {
    question: "What integrations are supported?",
    answer:
      "We support Salesforce, HubSpot, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Zoom, Slack, QuickBooks, and more. Visit the Integration Center to see all available connectors and their setup status.",
